## AT&T Hackathon 2017

Remember that time you wondered if that particular food would break that particular diet you were attempting to stick to?

Remember that time you wished the rabbi was there to tell you if it's kosher or not?

Remember that time you stared at that stick of butter and asked, "are you a carb?"

With our app, you'll get an immediate "yes" or "no" answer to those questions. Time is of the essence when you think you're about to break your diet or violate the Torah, so you can't be relying on internet search queries. Simply type in what you want to eat and what dietary restriction you're currently on, or trying to be on, and we'll tell you if you can eat it.

Or not. It's an app, not a cop.
